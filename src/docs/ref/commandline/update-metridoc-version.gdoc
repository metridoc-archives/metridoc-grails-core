grails updates-metridoc-version <job-name> [-includeSnapshots]
{code}

After creating a metridoc project, you might have noticed that within the @BuildConfig.groovy@ file, that the metridoc
version is surrounded by templating comments.  This script leverages this to update the version of the metridoc-core
plugin to the most recent one.  If you would like to use the most recent snapshot use the -includeSnapshots flag
