MetriDoc is developed in IntelliJ, and to a lesser extent Eclipse and vim.  Although IntelliJ is not free, it
is a very good IDE for Grails.  Education licenses for IntelliJ are very cheap.  You can find details for setting up
Grails in various IDE / Text editor environments [here|http://grails.org/doc/latest/guide/gettingStarted.html#ide]
