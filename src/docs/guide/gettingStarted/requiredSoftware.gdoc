* [Java 6 or above|http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html]
* [Grails 2.1.1|http://dist.springframework.org.s3.amazonaws.com/release/GRAILS/grails-2.0.4.zip] (optional, see below)
* [Mysql|http://www.mysql.com/]
* Subversion
* Text editor or IDE (IntelliJ, Eclipse or NetBeans)


Grails is optional.  Every project we build uses the [grails wrapper|http://grails.org/doc/latest/guide/commandLine.html#wrapper].
So for instance, if you are on a linux based system, simply run @./grailsw@ instead of grails at the top of the project.
This allows you to use grails with only the jvm installed!

At some point it is likely that MetriDoc will use 100% GORM for object relational mapping.  Unfortunately we still have
some parts that rely on MySql.  This should change in the future.

Many package managers have grails.  For instance, if you are using a mac, try [MacPorts|http://www.macports.org/]
and do @sudo port install grails@.  For Ubuntu you can follow the instructions on the bottom of the Grails download
[page|http://grails.org/Download/]

MetriDoc is developed in IntelliJ, and to a lesser extent Eclipse and vim.  Although IntelliJ is not free, it
is a very good IDE for Grails.  Education licenses for IntelliJ are very cheap.  You can find details for setting up
Grails in various IDE / Text editor environments [here|http://grails.org/doc/latest/guide/gettingStarted.html#ide]
