Upgrading is simple.  Just go into your BuildConfig.groovy file and change the version of metridoc that you are using.
For instance, say you see something like
{code}
compile (\":metridoc-core:0.52-SNAPSHOT\") {
    exclude "shiro-quartz"
}
{code}
in your @BuildConfig.groovy@.  You can change to version @0.52@ by just replacing @0.52-SNAPSHOT@ with @0.52@
