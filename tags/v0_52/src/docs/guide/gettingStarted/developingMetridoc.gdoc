If you are developing metridoc you will need to checkout MetriDoc trunk using subversion by running the command:

{code}
svn co https://metridoc.googlecode.com/svn/trunk
{code}

Many IDEs have version control support.  If you are using IntelliJ you can do @VCS -> Checkout from Version Control -> Subversion@.
Add the repository https://metridoc.googlecode.com/svn/trunk and follow the instructions.  By doing this, IntelliJ
will create a project structure for all the metridoc modules
